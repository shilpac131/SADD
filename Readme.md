## Speaker Aware Deepfake Detection

The code in this repository serves as audio deepfake detector. The link to the paper will be available soon [here](https://github.com/shilpac131/SADD.git).

## Experiments

The models are trained on the logical access (LA) train  partition of the ASVspoof 2019 dataset, which can can be downloaded from [here](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3336).

The models are tested on the LA partion of ASVspoof 2019 and 2021.

The code will be upated shortly.
